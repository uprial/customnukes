New features
* A radiation suit, so a player can roam the areas after you blow them up
* A new explosion type that replaces a set of blocks in a sphere to another set with a defined probability
* Integration with WorldGuard
* An ability to throw explosives
* Store persistent data in the "world" directory
* An ability to destroy specific blocks like obsidian
* It would be expected for the explosives not to damage areas claimed by other players which have explosions deactivated, and it'd also be expected for them not to apply any potion effects to the people inside those areas.
